# CucumberFramework
Here I have integrated Cucumber in my framework.

Wrote tests in Feature file.
Mapped it to Step Definition file.
Executed Test Runner Class.

Sometimes it feels very time consuming to work in Cucumber Framework
because it has lots of writing in terms of features.
Which is only useful if you have such kind of requirement
Like BDD FRAMEWORK or End user behaviour based framework.

And they who don't code can also read and contribute to feature file. Thats a advantage here.
